# Obscure - Chrome (WIP)
###### A chrome extension to conceal or blur specific elements on a page to be viewed or shared.
## What is *obscure*?
*To obscure is the act of concealing or keeping something from being seen. As such, this extension does exactly that.*
Have you ever taken a screenshot of a piece of sensitive information, such as a name or an address, only to have to open up your favorite photo-editing software to blur it out before finally uploading it to the internet? Ever had to cover up the answers to a math worksheet online to avoid seeing them while you review because you left it until the last minute? How about concealing the profile picture of that specific person you cannot stand? If so, *obscure* is for you. A lightweight extension to help remove or conceal elements for personal use or to share on the internet.
## How can I install *obscure*?
Once the extension is functional and deemed fit it will be uploaded to Chrome Webstore, from there it can be installed with a press of a button. For now, unless you're a developer the best thing you do is sit and wait. Maybe get a piece of paper and use that for the time being!
##### But I am a developer!
Awesome! Then feel free to help the project out, fork a version of your own, or simply criticize all the mistakes we make that you would have done differently. Regardless, it's a completely open-source project and any form of commitment helps! Hope to see you around.
## What are the plans for *obscure*?
Currently, the plan is to make something that works. After that, we can discuss the fun stuff. 
But future ideas are improving upon the functionality from a basic element hider. Make it so you can permanently hide elements or hide elements similar to the one you are currently hiding. Allow it to remember and adapt to all HTML pages of a website.
In addition to try and further improve the masking techniques in order to add blurs, complete color overlays, and even removal of the elements.
Once the main functionality of the program has been added focus on allowing an easy upload feature to share the obscured image as well as ensuring it works across all forms of documents such as HTML, PDFs, etc.
##### Okay, but what are *further* plans?
Well, that's not completely shaped out since the project is still in infancy but it would be nice to have a mobile version that allows these techniques to be used in real life. Perhaps an app that allows the user to instantly upload an image to a hosting site and make small adjustments such as blurring out a face or a street sign. Finally, this is one part of what could be included in a *Browser Suite*: a set of simple tools that usually require opening up other programs. For example, the ability to easily screenshot and save your favorite quote, a built-in color picker for finding that perfect shade of blue, the ability to switch between mobile and tablet versions of websites for developers, or quick notifications to find out that your favorite baseball just got removed from the league. *(sad face)* Nothing is fully flushed out, but in the end it would be an easy way to gain access to a bunch of tools quickly.
##F.A.Q:
#### - You're going to be supporting Firefox in the future, right?
Of course, the plan is currently to build the Chrome extension and move on to as many browsers as possible.
###### - How about Internet Explorer?
No.
#### - Does it cost anything?
For the user? No. However, down the road, it might cost us money to host websites and store images, but that hasn't been flushed out.
####  - Can I help?
Of course, your best bet would be to brush up on [Getting Started Creating Chrome Extensions]( https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted), as well as the [Basics of Github]( https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). Once you've completed that you should be able to look around the project and help out!
####  - Is *obscure* the official name?
Most likely not. At this current moment, nothing else comes to mind. Suggest something!
